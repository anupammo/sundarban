            <h4>Definition and Characteristics of the Mangrove Forest</h4>
            <p>The mangrove forest of Sundarban is characterized by its dense growth of mangrove trees, which thrive in brackish water and saline soil.

                <li><strong>Salt-Tolerant Flora:</strong> The vegetation is adapted to high salinity levels, with many species possessing mechanisms to excrete excess salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Tidal Influence:</strong> The forest is influenced by tidal movements, creating a dynamic environment where the water levels and salinity fluctuate.</li>
