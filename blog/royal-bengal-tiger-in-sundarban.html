        <h2 class="section-heading">The Royal Bengal Tiger: An Overview</h2>
        <h3>What is the Royal Bengal Tiger?</h3>
        <p>The Royal Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is a subspecies of tiger found predominantly in India and Bangladesh. Known for its striking orange coat with black stripes, the Royal Bengal Tiger is the most iconic and recognizable tiger species. In the Sundarbans, these tigers have adapted to a unique mangrove habitat, exhibiting behaviors and characteristics distinct from their forest-dwelling counterparts.</p>

        <h3>Physical Characteristics and Behavior</h3>
        <p>The Royal Bengal Tiger is distinguished by its muscular build, powerful limbs, and large size, with males weighing between 180 to 250 kilograms (400 to 550 pounds). Their striking coat provides camouflage in the dense mangrove forest. Tigers are solitary animals, marking large territories to ensure their dominance and find prey.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Habitat of the Royal Bengal Tiger in Sundarban</h2>
        <h3>The Unique Mangrove Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>The Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a vast mangrove forest located in the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers. This unique ecosystem is characterized by tidal waterways, mudflats, and a labyrinth of rivers and channels. The mangrove forest provides a complex and challenging habitat for the Royal Bengal Tiger, who have adapted to this environment with remarkable agility and stealth.</p>

        <h3>Adaptations to the Mangrove Forest</h3>
        <p>The Royal Bengal Tigers in the Sundarbans have evolved specific adaptations to thrive in their mangrove habitat. Their webbed paws help them navigate through the swampy terrain, and their excellent swimming ability allows them to cross rivers and channels in search of prey. Their striped coats blend seamlessly with the dappled sunlight and shadows of the mangrove forest, aiding in their stealthy hunting strategies.</p>

        <h3>Prey Species in the Sundarbans</h3>
        <p>The diet of the Royal Bengal Tiger in the Sundarbans primarily consists of various prey species adapted to the mangrove ecosystem. These include:</p>
        <ul class="custom-list">
            <li><strong>Chital (Spotted Deer):</strong> A common prey species that provides a significant portion of the tiger’s diet.</li>
            <li><strong>Wild Boar:</strong> Another important prey species that the tigers hunt in the dense undergrowth.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhesus Macaque:</strong> Occasionally targeted by tigers, especially in areas where other prey is scarce.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hunting Techniques and Territory</h3>
        <p>Royal Bengal Tigers are solitary hunters, relying on their stealth and strength to ambush prey. They use their keen sense of hearing and smell to locate potential victims. The tigers establish and defend large territories, which they mark with scent to ward off rivals and signal their presence to potential mates.</p>
