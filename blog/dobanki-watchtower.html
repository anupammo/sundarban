                    <p class="lead fs-6">1. Elevated Canopy Walk for Wildlife Viewing</p>
                    <p class="lead fs-6">One of the most distinctive features of the Dobanki Watchtower is its canopy walk, which stretches about 500 meters through the dense mangrove forest. This elevated walkway is a thrilling experience, as it allows you to walk above the forest floor, giving a bird’s-eye view of the lush surroundings. From here, you can observe wildlife in its natural habitat, including spotted deer, wild boars, and sometimes even tigers in the distance.</p>

                    <p class="lead fs-6">2. Unique Wildlife Sightings</p>
                    <p class="lead fs-6">The Dobanki Watchtower is a fantastic spot for animal sightings, offering visitors a chance to spot some of the most sought-after creatures in Sundarban. The tidal rivers that snake through the mangrove forest are home to saltwater crocodiles, which can often be seen basking on the riverbanks. Birdwatchers will also find Dobanki to be a paradise, with species like storks, egrets, and kingfishers frequently spotted from the watchtower.</p>

                    <p class="lead fs-6">3. Royal Bengal Tiger Sightings</p>
                    <p class="lead fs-6">Sundarban is famous for being the habitat of the elusive Royal Bengal Tiger, and Dobanki Watchtower provides a rare opportunity to witness these majestic animals in the wild. Although tiger sightings are not guaranteed, Dobanki’s strategic location near the core area of the reserve increases your chances of spotting one of these regal creatures.</p>

                    <p class="lead fs-6">4. Tranquil Experience Away from Crowds</p>
                    <p class="lead fs-6">Unlike some of the more popular watchtowers in Sundarban, Dobanki Watchtower offers a quieter, more serene experience. This makes it an ideal destination for those looking to escape the crowds and enjoy the natural beauty of Sundarban in a peaceful setting.</p>
