            <h2>Detailed Day-Wise Itinerary</h2>
            <h3>Day 1: Explore the Mystical Sundarban</h3>
            <h4>5:00 AM: Departure from Kolkata</h4>
            <p>Your adventure begins early in the morning with a departure from Kolkata. Depending on your location, our
                tour will start from a convenient pick-up point of your choice within the city. Enjoy a comfortable
                three-hour drive through scenic landscapes as we make our way to Sundarban Godkhali, the gateway to the
                majestic mangrove forest. A short tea break will be provided en route to refresh yourself before diving
                into the day's excitement.</p>

            <h4>8:30 AM – 9:00 AM: Begin Your Sundarban Experience</h4>
            <p>Upon arrival at Godkhali, board our mechanized, well-maintained boat equipped with comfortable beds and
                European toilets. This boat will serve as your floating base as you explore the intricate network of
                creeks and delta regions that define the Sundarban. Set sail into the heart of the mangrove forest,
                where you might encounter diverse wildlife, including crocodiles, water monitors, spotted deer, and an
                array of bird species. With a bit of luck, you could even catch a glimpse of the elusive Royal Bengal
                Tiger in its natural habitat. During the boat ride, we will visit three prominent watchtowers:
                Sajnekhali, Sudhanyakhali, and Dobanki, offering panoramic views of the forest and its wildlife.</p>

            <h4>Breakfast and Lunch: Culinary Delights Onboard</h4>
            <p>Indulge in freshly prepared meals as you cruise through the Sundarban. Our onboard service ensures that
                you enjoy a delicious breakfast and lunch, made with local ingredients to complement your adventure.</p>

            <h4>4:00 PM – 5:00 PM: Return Journey to Kolkata</h4>
            <p>As the day draws to a close, we start our journey back to Kolkata. Relax and reflect on the day's
                experiences as we cruise back through the waterways and roads.</p>

            <h4>8:00 PM – 9:00 PM: Arrival in Kolkata</h4>
            <p>We aim to return to Kolkata between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM, bringing your Sundarban adventure to a close. We
                hope that your day was filled with wonder and excitement, making it a memorable outing.</p>
